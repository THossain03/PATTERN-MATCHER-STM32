# PATTERN-MATCHER-STM32

# THIS PROJECT REQUIRES THE USE OF THE STM32-NUCLEO BOARD, WHERE THE BLACK RESET BUTTON (GPIOA_PIN_15) AND THE BLUE START BUTTON (GPIPA_PIN_13) WILL BE REQUIRED TO 
# START THE GAME AND THE LEVELS RESPECTIVELY. SOFTWARE REQUIRES TO FIRST BE UPLOADED TO THE CENTRAL STM BOARD, AND CIRCUITS FOR 6 SEPERATE LED SYSTEMS NEED TO BE UTILIZED FOR 
# GENERATING LED OUTPUT. IN ADDITION, FOR INPUT RECEPTION TO THE SOFTWARE SYSTEM, A KEYPAD NEEDS TO BE CONNECTED (PREFERABLY THE 4X4 "123A456B789C*0#D" VERSION) TO PINS 7,8,9,
# AND 10 FOR GPIO PORT A. UTILIZING THIS HARDWARE AND HAVING AT LEAST ONE USB PORT TO CONNECT THE WHOLE BOARD SYSTEM TO WILL ALLOW THE USER TO BE ACCESS 
# THE ULTIMATE PATTERN MATCHER LOCK PROTOTYPE.
